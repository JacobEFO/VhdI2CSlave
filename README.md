# I2C Slave

## Use
To properly use this, you must have both `ghdl` and `gtkwave`. In addition TBD.

## Target FPGA Board
This design is targetted for the Basys2 FPGA board from Digilent. It offers
a Xilinx Spartan3E-100 CP-132.

The board offers three different clock sources, 25 MHz, 50 MHz or 100 MHz.
